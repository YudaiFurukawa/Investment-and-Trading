# Build a Stock Price Indicator #

## Definition ##
### Project Overview ###
Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process.
### Problem Statement ###
For this project, the task is to build a stock price predictor that takes trading data over a certain time range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. 
Going to use regression
### Metrics ###
The coefficient of determination (r2 score), will be used for scoring the result of the prediction in this task. 
r2 score will be sufficient for this project as the problem of this product is regression, and r2 score is a number that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
